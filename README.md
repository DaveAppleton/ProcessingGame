===============

A couple of years ago I was teaching a class on Processing at HackerSpace and, since we only had two students and tehy were pretty advanced, we ran out of material.

So we started developing something to see where it would go.

I did a small touch up after to add the music and graphics (in memory of Commander Keen) but apart from that
this is what we came up with.

Enjoy.
